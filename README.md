### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel and I spend most of my days (Monday-Friday ðŸ¤ª) working on software frameworks. I know Python and Java like the back of my hand, but recently Swift has been stealing my heart. I'm a bit of an Apple fanboy.

When I'm not busy at work, I try to solve problems in my life and my wife's life. You can find my active projects on [my website](https://daniel.copley.dev) and I am occasionally active on X at [@djrcopley](https://twitter.com/djrcopley)

If you want to get in touch, you can send me a message on X.
