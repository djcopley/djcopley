### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel and I spend my week days working on software frameworks. Python has historically been my language of choice, but recently Swift has been stealing my heart.

When I'm not busy at work, I try to solve problems in my life and my wife's life. You can find my active projects on [my website](https://daniel.copley.dev) and I am occasionally active on X at [@djrcopley](https://twitter.com/djrcopley)

If you want to get in touch, you can send me a message on X.
